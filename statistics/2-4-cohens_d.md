[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

The problem wants to find if there is a difference between the first born and all other born children relative to the variability within the groups.

The Cohen's D when comparing first born to all other babies is "-0.0886729270726" which is relatively small which suggest there is not a significatn difference between when a baby is born in relation to their siblings.

Cohen's D was calculated by taking the difference between the means of the first born and all other born childen and dividing it by the pooled standard deviation.
