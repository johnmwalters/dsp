[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

Spearman's Corr: 0.0946100410966
Pearson's Corr: 0.0688339703541

Pearson's correlation is very close to zero (it can have a vlue between -1 and 1) which suggets there is little correlation between birth weight and mother's age.

Spearmans's correlation is also very low, but slightly higher than Pearson's correlation. This suggests there may be a bit of a non linear relationship between birth weight and mother's age or there are outliers in the data.
