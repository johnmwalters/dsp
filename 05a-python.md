# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

>> Lists and Tuples both contain a group of strings or numbers; they are both in the literal sense, a list. Tuples, however are unmutable. Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are unmutable

###Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

>> Lists and sets, in their literal sesne, are lists of items. Sets however, cannot have duplicate values, if you try to assign duplicate values to a set, only one item will remain. Sets are much faster at finding an element becuase when you search for an element in a list you have to compare each individual item to determine if it is the unique value you want while a set only contains unique values.

###Q3. Lambda Function

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.

>> Lamda is a method to perform a function within function arguments. If you wanted to sort a list of things as a new list in reverse order, you would perform the following operation:

    sorted_objects = sorted(list_of_things, key = lambda x: x.count, reverse = True)

###Q4. List Comprehension, Map &amp; Filter

Explain list comprehensions. Give examples and show equivalents with `map` and `filter`. How do their capabilities compare? Also demonstrate set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

>> List comprehensions: Create a new list by applying functions or maniplating another list.

###Complete the following problems by editing the files below:

###Q5. Datetime
Use Python to compute days between start and stop date.   
a.  

```
date_start = '01-02-2013'    
date_stop = '07-28-2015'
```

>> 937 days

b.  
```
date_start = '12312013'  
date_stop = '05282015'  
```

>> 513 days

c.  
```
date_start = '15-Jan-1994'      
date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'  
```

>> 7850 days
